# Services

[Micro Services](https://github.com/micro/services) provide additional functionality via external third party services.

## Overview

Go Micro provides core abstractions for building distributed systems which are likely 
direct dependencies on locally hosted infrastructure. In the case of external services 
such as sending email, sms, etc we leave this up to the user. Yet they are becoming 
more core to all forms of distributed systems development beyond infrastructure.

This directory serves as guidance for accessing external Micro services managed 
and hosted by [m3o.com](https://m3o.com) and powered by [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro).
